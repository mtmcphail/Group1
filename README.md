## Machine Learning Model 

The proposed machine learning model at this stage is a linear regression that takes in race and county data to predict the percentage of the target demographic that lives within 0.25 miles from a liquor outlet. This target variable may also be changed from continuous to categorical (for example, 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 75%-100) so as to perform a logistical regression. 

Once more county data from other data sets, more models will be possible, such as a binary classifier that predicts whether child poverty is persistent in an area using race, county, income levels, and unemployment levels.

# Liquor Licences and Close-Proximity Population Demographics  


## Overview

The CDC publishes a fascinating dataset detailing the racial/ethic percentages of persons living within 0.25 miles of an establishment with a liquor license.   


Layering additional demographic data including income levels, proverty indicators

This project **hopes to answer the following questions**:

* Is there a racial or ethnic population more likely to live within a quarter mile of a liquor licensed establishment?
* What is the racial or ethnic breakdown of populations within a quarter mile of a liquor licensed establishment? 

Ultimately, the goal is to build a machine learning model (using logistical regression)that can **predict the likelihood of a liquor outlet is within a quarter miles of a person's home based on their race and location**. 

## Data Source
There are 3 data sources used to build this model:

* Primary data source, xxxx comes from 

This dataset contains




## GitHub and Communication Protocol

### GitHub
In order to accomplish this massive task, this team will be utilizing GitHUb to collaborate.  In addition to our main (or master branch), this repository contains the following branches: 

* Triangle or Machine Learning Role```devin_branch```
* X or Technology ```jackie_data_analytics```
* Square or GitHub Management Role```maggies_data_analysis```:
* Circle or Dtaabase Role```nazanin-data-analytics```Role

Each week, our team will have a minimum of 4 commits each week.  For Week 1:




### Communication Protocol
In addition to utilizing GitHub and our Slack channel, this team will meet weekly during and/or before normal class times on **Wednesday evening** as well as via zoom as needed.

Each team member has a role to play and for **Week 1** they are: 

* **Circle Role (Database)**:  Nazanin Tavakoli
* **Triangle Role (Machine Learning)**  Devin Hollister 
* **Square Role (GitHub)**: Maggie McPhail 
* **X Role (Technology)**: Jackie Chitsanga

Once a team member is ready with their portion of the assignment, the Square will be notified, create a pull request and resolve any resulting conflicts. The rest of the team will be notified via Slack when to pull the updated main branch.
   
## Database

First step in creating this predictive model and getting the answers we are looking for, is to import the raw data into SQL and create a schema outlining the table structure and interconnections.

This is done using **PostGres** and **SQL**; ERD schmatic below: 



Once the team is ready to start analyzing, the data is connected to a **Python** Notebook to be read in. 
 
clean, and preprocess our dataset.  That's where the fun begins! 

The following **technologies**, modules, and functions within **Python** will be used to read in, prepare and transform the data: 

* pandas
* sklearn.model_selection: ```train_test_split```
* sklearn.preprocessing: ```StandardScaler``` 
* sklearn.preprocessing: ```OneHotEncoder```


## Machine Learning Model
Once the dataset is cleaned and transformed, we can start compiling, training, and evaluating the model.  

* tensorflow: keras

## Dashboard Presentation
The dashboard will be built using **Tableau**.  Visualizations to tell this story will including graphs, heat maps and interactive predictions.  Look out for our findings in the coming weeks!
